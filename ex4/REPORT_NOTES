For an M*N carton with limit K, the optimal solution will have NUM_EGGS = K * min(M, N).
We use this to simplify the problem. The start should be a carton with NUM_EGGS already distributed.
A neighboring carton is generated by swapping one egg to an open slot, keeping the number of eggs constant.

With this known, our obj_func does not need to penalize open slots in any way,
because we know the number of eggs is correct, it is just their placement that is to be considered.
The obj_func therefore penalizes one point per egg OVER K in each row, column and diagonal.
The sum of all penalties is then compared to the absolute worst score achievable (eggs in every slot),
resulting in a score between 0 (worst) and 1 (optimal solution).

Testing with SOLUTION552 gives a score of 1.
