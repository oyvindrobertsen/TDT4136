\section*{Similarities and differences between heuristics and objective functions}

While a heuristic function gives us an estimate of how likely a possible choice in a search process is to lead to the goal, an objective function, as the name implies, objectively grades a complete, valid or invalid, solution. 
The heuristic function is contextual in that it's result depends on the path taken and the way to go, while the objective function is deterministic regardless of in which context it is being called.
