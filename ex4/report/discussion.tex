\section*{General description}

Our implementation of the Simulated Annealing algorithm is a pretty straightforward translation of the pseudocode in the handout.
We have wrapped the search procedure in a class encapsulating some of the properties of an SA-problem for convenience.
The starting solution is the only parameter passed to the search function itself.
